# Use IFTTT and the lemon.markets API to trade in the stock market with services like Google Assistant 
Code Snippet (Incomplete) which is part of the IFTTT implementation to execute trading on the stock market with Google's virutal assistant including the lemon.markets API. 

## Instructions for Use
This script can be used as a starting point to implement your own trading service with lemon.markets for your virtual assistant from Amazon.
As you can already see, it only contains the Python code that you can use for AWS.
AWS is an environment which allows you to add coding files into their cloud systems for hosting IFTTT implementation.  

If you're not sure about how to use the lemon.markets API for the project, I'd recommend you to read the document to learn more about how to implement the lemon.markets API into your projects.

## Environmental Variables
You'll notice that the script uses several environment variables to include the API. Please define the following in an .env file or within your IDE:

- API_KEY - Your lemon.markets API key
- stock_dict - Add the stocks you'd like to buy/sell with Virtual Assistants
